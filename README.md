# Cryptr with Symfony API

## 01 - Configuration

🛠️️ First, open up your terminal and create this new Symfony project by typing this command:

```bash
composer create-project symfony/skeleton cryptr-symfony-api-sample
```

This creates a new folder called `cryptr-symfony-api-sample` and configures your application in that folder

Note: __Composer is a dependency manager in PHP. With it, you can declare the dependent libraries your project needs and they will be installed in your project by this tool. See Composer's getting started doc for more information.__

🛠️️ Once it’s finished, go to your project with command `cd cryptr-symfony-api-sample`

You can start the application by running `symfony server:start`
